=head1 NAME

Hijk - Specialized HTTP client

=head1 SYNOPSIS

A simple GET request:

    use Hijk;
    my $res = Hijk::request({
        method       => "GET",
        host         => "example.com",
        port         => "80",
        path         => "/flower",
        query_string => "color=red"
    });

    die unless ($res->{status} == "200");

    say $res->{body};

A POST request, you have to manually set the appropriate headers, URI
escape your values etc.

    use Hijk;
    use URI::Escape qw(uri_escape);

    my $res = Hijk::request({
        method       => "POST",
        host         => "example.com",
        port         => "80",
        path         => "/new",
        head         => [ "Content-Type" => "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" ],
        query_string => "type=flower&bucket=the%20one%20out%20back",
        body         => "description=" . uri_escape("Another flower, let's hope it's exciting"),
    });

    die unless ($res->{status} == "200");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Hijk is a specialized HTTP Client that does nothing but transporting the
response body back. It does not feature as a "user agent", but as a dumb
client. It is suitble for connecting to data servers transporting via HTTP
rather then web servers.

Most of HTTP features like proxy, redirect, Transfer-Encoding, or SSL are not
supported at all. For those requirements we already have many good HTTP clients
like L<HTTP::Tiny>, L<Furl> or L<LWP::UserAgent>.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 Hijk::request( $args :HashRef ) :HashRef

This is the only function to be used. It is not exported to its caller namespace
at all. It takes a request arguments in HashRef and returns the response in HashRef.

The C<$args> request arg should contain key-value pairs from the following
table. The value for C<host> and C<port> are mandatory and others are optional
with default values listed below

=over 4

=item host => ...

=item port => ...

=item timeout => 0

=item method => "GET"

=item path => "/"

=item query_string => ""

=item head => []

=item body => ""

=back

Too keep the implementation straight-forward, Hijk does not take full URL string
as input.

The value of C<head> is an ArrayRef of key-value pairs instead of HashRef, this way
the order of headers can be maintained. For example:

    head => [
        "Content-Type" => "application/json",
        "X-Requested-With" => "Hijk",
    ]

... will produce these request headers:

    Content-Type: application/json
    X-Requested-With: Hijk

Again, there are no extra character-escaping filter within Hijk.

The value of C<timeout> is in seconds, and is used as the time limit for both
connecting to the host, and reading from the socket. The default value C<0>
means that there is no timeout limit. If the host is really unreachable, it will
reach the system TCP timeout limit then dies.

The return vaue is a HashRef representing a response. It contains the following
key-value pairs.

=over 4

=item status => :StatusCode

=item body => :Str

=item head => :HashRef

=back

For example, to send request to C<http://example.com/flower?color=red>, use the
following code:

    my $res = Hijk::request({
        host => "example.com",
        port => "80",
        path => "/flower",
        query_string => "color=red"
    });
    die "Response is not OK" unless $res->{status} ne "200";

Notice that you do not need to put the leading C<"?"> character in the
C<query_string>. You do, however, need to propery C<uri_escape> the content of
C<query_string>.

All values are assumed to be valid. Hijk simply passthru the values without
validating the content. It is possible that it constructs invalid HTTP Messages.
Users should keep this in mind when using Hijk.

Noticed that the C<head> in the response is a HashRef rather then an ArrayRef.
This makes it easier to retrieve specific header fields.

We currently don't support returning a body without a Content-Length
header, bodies B<MUST> have an accompanying Content-Length or we won't
pick them up.
