- We can now talk HTTP/1.0 an addition to HTTP/1.1, have a way to
  disable the socket cache, and can specify connect and read timeouts
  independently.
- Fix a really nasty bug with mixings up requests after encountering a
  timeout. See
  http://lists.unbit.it/pipermail/uwsgi/2013-December/006802.html for
  details.
- Remove spurious requirenment on perl v5.14.2
- First stab at https://github.com/gugod/Hijk/issues/3 we'll now
  return an error key in the response with
  Hijk::Error::{CONNECT_TIMEOUT,READ_TIMEOUT} instead of dying.
- Nuked the Hijk::HTTP::XS support from the repo, we've decided it was
  too complex for its own good.
- Add support for an on_connect callback for seeing how long the
  connect/reads take.

- KEEP CALM AND REMOVE FETCH OPTION
- Hijk::request will use XS parser only if Hijk::HTTP::XS is loaded

- We only checked for undefined return codes from POSIX::read(), not
  0, resulting in an infinite select/read loop when a server with
  keep-alive enabled cut off our connection.

- Handle syswrite() returning undef without spewing an uninitialized
  comparison error
- Various work on the test suite.
